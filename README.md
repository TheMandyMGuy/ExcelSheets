This sheet was created for the purpose of projecting a lead time for orders of any number/combination of products in a sewn goods manufacturing environment. It utilizes time data about every process involved, from creation to shipping, for each of the products listed to create formulas that would estimate and generate these lead times as outputs.

For individual products, put the desired order quantity in the “Order Qty” column in the same row as the listed product, then input the number of sewers involved in the “# Sewers Committed” column. This will generate a lead time in both business days and weeks. Otherwise, for multiple item orders, put the desired order quantity for each next to the respective products in the “Order Qty” column, the same way as before, but only enter the number of sewers committed once at the very bottom of the “# Sewers Committed” column. This will generate a lead time in days and weeks for the entire order.
